Transit Directions:

Use given:
 - stop_times.txt: trip_id, stop_id, (arrival_time ?)
 - stops.txt:      stop_id, stop_lat, stop_lon (stop_name ?)
 - trips.txt:      trip_id, route_id

Create:
 - my_df: route_id, stop_id, stop_lat, stop_lon, time
 - by getting trips closest to noon and taking arrival_times from them

Graph:
 - Nodes: stop_id, pos
 - Edges: travel_time, [(route_id, direction_id)]


Notes:
 - in stop_times, arrival_time == departure_time for all entries

TODO:
 - get trip and route name, compare
 - stop ignoring stops that don't appear on mode trips. Right now only using 9155/9691
 - USE DIRECTION ID
